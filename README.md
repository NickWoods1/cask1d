`cask1d`
********

`cask1d` is a python package designed to compute the ground
state energy of a molecular system in one-dimension using
various approximations. `cask1d` is non-periodic
 and uses a delta function basis set.

Functionality
*************

`dft` generates the Kohn-Sham self-consistent single-particle
wavefunctions, total energy, and density given a
certain exchange-correlation potential and set of atomic
positions and species.   

`h` generates Hartree self-consistent single-particle 
wavefunctions, total energy, and density.

`hf` generates Hartree-Fock self-consistent single-particle
wavefunctions, total energy, and density. 

`tf` generates Thomas-Fermi density and energy
